"""The set of adapters automation may run, and how to invoke each one.

Automation needs three things an adapter module cannot state about itself:
which datastore collections it is allowed to write, the exact argv that makes
it write somewhere other than the checkout, and how long it may take. Parsing
that back out of each adapter's ``argparse`` block is what an earlier
scheduled-ingestion attempt did, and it silently mis-read adapters whose CLI
conventions differed. This module is the declaration instead, and
``tests/test_adapter_catalog.py`` checks every entry against the adapter's own
parser, so an entry cannot drift from the code it describes.

Every adapter package under ``every_eval_ever/adapters/`` must appear here or
in :data:`LEGACY_ADAPTERS`. An adapter that cannot be scheduled is listed with
``runnable=False`` and a reason, so it stays visible.

Named catalog rather than registry because "the registry" already means
``eval-card-registry`` throughout this project's docs and contribution flow.
