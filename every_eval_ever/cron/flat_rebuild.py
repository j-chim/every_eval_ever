"""Rebuild the datastore's flat view against the Hub, without a clone.

``tools/build_flat_datastore.py`` in the EEE_datastore repository defines the
flat layout and rebuilds it from a local checkout. That checkout no longer
fits a GitHub Actions runner — ``data/`` alone is ~15 GB — so this module
writes the same flat layout against the Hub API instead:

1. read the current snapshot: ``flat/latest_manifest.json`` and the
   ``entries.jsonl`` it points at;
2. recursively list the repository and diff ``data/`` against the snapshot
   rows, using file size as the change signal;
3. download new and size-changed source files (a full initial build is gated
   behind ``--allow-bootstrap``);
4. rebuild rows, collection indexes and the manifest, preserving published
   bytes, accepting reserialization and reporting conflicting UUID reuse;
   mark superseded rows (see ``apply_supersession``), backfilling the
   ``evaluation_id`` of inherited rows that predate the field;
5. retire collection indexes whose collection no longer exists under
   ``data/`` (moved to ``flat/indexes/retired/``), trim snapshots past the
   retention window, and commit everything in bounded batches with the
   adapter ingestion's retry discipline (``cron.submit``).

The retention rule keeps any manifest that is the last remaining index into
an object, so no object in ``flat/objects/`` ever loses its row. Objects are
never deleted, and ``data/`` is never touched: it is the source of truth,
maintained by the ingestion cron and human pull requests. Records are not
validated here either — the ingestion cron validated each one before
committing it.

A run whose rebuilt manifest core hash matches the published one and that
has no missing index, retire or retention work commits nothing. Conflicts
not listed in ``flat_acknowledged_conflicts.txt`` still produce exit code 2;
comparison failures and verification drift stop publication with an error.
