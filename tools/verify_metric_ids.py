"""Check the converters' canonical metric ids against an eval-card-registry checkout.

`CANONICAL_METRIC_IDS` in `converters/common/metrics.py` is resolved by hand so a
converter needs no network and gives the same answer every run. This re-does that
resolution against a registry `seed/metrics.yaml` and reports three things: a
mapped id the registry no longer carries, a name that now resolves but is still
namespaced, and a name that resolves ambiguously (two canonical ids claim it,
which is a registry-side collision rather than anything to fix here).

    uv run python -m tools.verify_metric_ids --seed ../eval-card-registry/seed/metrics.yaml

Exits non-zero when anything disagrees, so it can gate a registry bump. Not part
of the test suite: it needs a checkout of a different repository.
