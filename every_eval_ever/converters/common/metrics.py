"""What a metric's name tells us about its identity, its range and its polarity.

Upstream harnesses report a metric's value and almost never its range, so the
range has to come from the metric's definition. The names below mean the same
thing in every harness we convert, so their bounds are shared; anything whose
scale is harness-specific belongs in that converter's own table, layered on top
of `SHARED_METRIC_BOUNDS`. `bleu` is the cautionary example: sacrebleu (lm-eval)
reports 0-100 while nltk's `sentence_bleu` (HELM's `bleu_1`/`bleu_4`) reports
0-1, so the bare name cannot carry a range. `chrf` is held back from
`CANONICAL_METRIC_IDS` for the same reason: the registry's entry is on [0, 1]
while lm-eval's sacrebleu value is 0-100 (eval-card-registry#57 tracks it).

A metric that is in no table gets no bounds at all and a `bounds_status` marker,
because `min_score`/`max_score` are nullable and "not provided" is true, while
[0, 1] on an unbounded metric is not.

`metric_id` is the field a consumer joins on across sources, so a metric that
means the same thing in two harnesses has to arrive under the same id. That id
is the eval-card-registry's canonical metric slug, resolved once by hand into
`CANONICAL_METRIC_IDS` rather than over the network, because a converter has to
run offline and give the same answer every time. Anything the registry does not
carry gets `<harness>.<name>`, which is a stable join key within the harness and
claims no global identity; `metric_id_status` marks those so the set needing a
registry entry can be listed. Re-check the map against a registry checkout with
`uv run python -m tools.verify_metric_ids --seed <registry>/seed/metrics.yaml`.
