"""Shared machinery for testing a converter against a committed upstream log.

One `ConverterCase` per converter is all it takes to be covered by
`tests/test_converter_conversion.py`: point it at a real log the upstream tool wrote,
give the CLI arguments a user would give, and state what the conversion should yield.

Adding a converter here does not require writing a test.
